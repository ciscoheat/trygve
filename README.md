# trygve
The trygve language project - Building a DCI-centric language from the ground up

For now, all pull requests will be rejected without ceremony. The code is under heavy development. We'll open it up a bit further a bit later, probably in 1Q2017.

## Running

Just build and execute with `gradlew run`.

## Developing

Import as a Gradle project into your IDE. (Or as a regular project if you wish.) To rebuild ANTLR parser run `gradlew antlr`. To build a distribution `gradlew build`.
